# Depth First Traversal  Steps - Each Branch At A Time
# initialize a stack
# push root to stack
# while stack not empty 
    # pop top item out of stack and into temp
    # if you are doing something with traversal - maybe you are tallying up each item in traversal, maybe doing a search
    # if temp has right right put into stack
    # if temp has left put into stack


# does it have a right? if it does, we .... 
# does it have a left, if it does, we .... 


# Breadth First Traversal - Each level at a time
# Everything from above changed to queue
# initialize a queue
# push root to queue
# while stack not empty 
    # pop top item out of queue and into temp
    # if you are doing something with traversal - maybe you are tallying up each item in traversal, maybe doing a search
    # if temp has right right put into queue
    # if temp has left put into queue
